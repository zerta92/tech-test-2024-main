# Project Setup

## Requirements
- Node.js v20  

## Running the Backend
1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:  
2. Install dependencies:  `yarn install`
3. Start the backend server:  `yarn start`

### Running Tests
1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:  
2. Run tests:  `yarn test`

## Running the Frontend
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:  
2. Install dependencies:  `yarn install`
3. Start the frontend server:  `yarn start`


## Accessing the App
Once both servers are running, open:  
[http://localhost:3000/welcome/ff535484-6880-4653-b06e-89983ecf4ed5](http://localhost:3000/welcome/ff535484-6880-4653-b06e-89983ecf4ed5)
 - where the value after *welcome/* is the user id

## Thoughts on the Test
I personally enjoyed the challenge and appreciated that the tasks were concise and straight to the point. Setting up the frontend and backend environments took a fair amount of time, so it might have been easier if some of this overhead was already taken care of, but I can see why this would be part of the exercise.
